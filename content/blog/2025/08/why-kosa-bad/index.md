In this article I just wanted to mention why KOSA (Kid's Online Safety Act) would be bad for the internet if it's passed. Just to make this available for those who prefer written articles and to have it be a more consistent link that can be shared.

First of all: I am someone who believes that children should be able to be safe online. But I know enough about the internet and technology in general to understand that over-regulation can harm the internet as well. So here goes.

## Censorship

Parts of the bill are too vague and could be interpreted as "anything we don't like" by the sitting administration at the time.

Such as [Section 102 sub a item 2](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7891/text#H028F00C2EA62423FA641CABB9AEB6A22), even though it is defined in [Section 101 item 2](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7891/text#HC88BF06953504C7187B45C64FF2DF803) the term "mental health disorder" is not objective, and can mean information that may develop a dissenting opinion.

Love or hate it, this can lead to platforms over-censoring content lest they piss off a current sitting administration.
