I may be a little weird, sitting down to do some updates to my website on my birthday. But this is the way I express myself, is by having a personal website.

So here I am. Highlighting the updates.

* Pages now have revision dates
    * I'm surprised this one took me as long as it did, as one of my pet peeves are static information pages on the internet which do not have a revision or "last modified" date on them. So it is hard to tell if information on the internet is up to date or not.
* Blog page now has a paginator functionality built-in
    * Once my site gets 18 or more blog posts it will start paginating automatically. Cool stuff.
* Added a Subscribe page
    * No, I am not shilling for some big-tech privacy-invading subscriptions platform. Instead, I decided to link to a couple of feeds which my Hugo instance creates automatically. So you can plug those links into an RSS reader of your choice.

## Thanks for the birthday wishes

Since I may not have a lot of time today or the next few days, I'd like to extend a universal thank-you to those who are wishing me a happy birthday.
