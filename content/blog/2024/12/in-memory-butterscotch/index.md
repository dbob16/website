I wrote this a little bit later but decided to post this on my website as well. On December 2nd, 2024; I lost my beloved Butterscotch to chronic kidney disease. She will be missed. This article is for her memory.

So at least for now I'll keep a memorial of her in my home, on that bookshelf she liked to lay on:

She used to lay there and watch me make edits to this site and my other projects, if she wasn't in my lap, purring while I worked.
