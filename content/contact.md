I'm basic, I just have an email that I use as a primary contact funnel. And that is gillulyd AT gmail DOT com.

Even though I have other, custom domain emails, their spam filters don't work as well so I don't like to advertise them or use them for general correspondence.

Also, I'm not answering any emails or calls from so-called "web and app developers." I have a website, you're looking at it. And I don't need an app, if I did, I'd figure that out too.
