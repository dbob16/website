My name is Dilan Gilluly and welcome to my site. By day I'm a tier 2/3 tech support representative and by night I like to tinker with technology, exercise, and read.

The projects that I work on and wish to make public are available on [Github here](https://www.github.com/dbob16/).

On top of being handy in a technological sense, I am a Christian and engage in theological discussions sometimes. For those who maybe reading this and want to know what Christianity is about, check out the downloadable PTL I can offer you at [PTL.org](https://members.ptl.org/GOJ/910243).

Some content I post will be available here on this site, so feel free to browse around.

## What do I stand for

A list of the following causes that I stand for:

* Right to Repair
  * Likely the only hill I'll die on politically, but I believe that people should have a right to repair what they want, however they want to as long as it doesn't pose a danger to others.
* Security and Privacy
  * I feel that people should have some expectation of privacy when doing things on their computers or devices when it doesn't involve posting publicly on the internet.
* Censorship
  * Unless something is objectively harmful, I don't believe that it should be censored from the internet.
* Liberty
  * I believe that adults should be able to do what they want to do as long as they're not objectively harming others. This includes both physical activities and those conducted online. As well as choosing what device you want to use. I am not a device supremacist, nor do I try to "recruit" others to use the same devices I do unless I have a good reason to do so (like if someone asks for a recommendation)
