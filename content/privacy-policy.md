For this privacy policy, I want to start out by saying that this is just a formality. I personally don't like collecting data on people, so I don't have this website to collect information.

## Definitions

- "this site" = Dilan's Site at dilangilluly.us.

## Information

This website runs off of Nginx, which means by default it logs the following:

- IP Addresses - Which unlike hollywood movies, amounts to learning what ISP someone uses and maybe the nearest city to them. Unless there's a lot of ports forwarded on that particular person's router, there's not much that can be done with IP addresses alone.
- Page - The page path of the page that the browser requested. (After the GET in example. "/" is the home page.)
- User Agent - Information on what kind of device and web browser you're using. Keep in mind this does **not** include usernames, legal names, etc.

An example:

> x.x.x.x (IP Address removed) - - [23/Apr/2024:14:37:01 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 304 0 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:125.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/125.0"

So, yes, pretty limited. It usually doesn't get usernames or anything like that. And I usually don't view such logs as I'm not really interested in it. 

## Cookies

Cookies have not been implemented on this site as of yet.

## Children's Information

As this site does not collect any information other than regular webserver logging, and doesn't even have forms to input such information. So since this site doesn't collect any identifying information for any visitors, this site doesn't collect information about children under the age of 13, at least not knowingly by me, the webmaster of my own site. If you feel that your child somehow inadvertently provided said data, contact me using the email on my [contact](/contact) page, and I'll try to be prompt in removing such information.

With that aside I am in full support of parents monitoring and coordinating web usage with their children, including filtering on their children's devices. If you feel that my content is inappropriate for your child to view, I have no problem with you blocking it.

## Direct contact

If an audience member of this site decides to engage in direct contact with me, the site owner, privacy of such communication is dependent on the entity involved in each link on the chain between your email platform and Gmail, which is the email address I have provided on my contact page.

Google's/Gmail's Privacy policy is visible [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US).

## Acceptance

By continuing to view my site you agree with the privacy policy above.
