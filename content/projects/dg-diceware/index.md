Indroducing DG Diceware. A web based version of the original diceware app I created in Python.

Features:

- Runs locally so your passphrases aren't logged by the server at all
- Allows you to roll physical dice and enter the result with instantaneous feedback
- You can also use the application to generate random passphrases for you
- Add caps and numbers to your final passphrase for maximum effectiveness
