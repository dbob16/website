## This is under **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

I was working with Ticket Auction Manager this past year and thought "what if this was available to those who don't use Microsoft products."

So then I started learning more and more about Python programming, learned about ttk, treeviews, had to experiment to figure out which methods worked, which ones didn't.

Then learning a bit about SQLAlchemy ORM, I decided to give it a go. So here it is, my first attempt at making a large project orientated to be accessible to the cross-platform market.
