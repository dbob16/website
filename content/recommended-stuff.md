This is a page I'll update on the regular (hopefully) with some things I use and recommend. Feel free to check back to see if anything has changed.

## Applications

Since I sometimes switch to Linux for a while some of these will be available for both Linux and Windows. I'll put what each application is available for in the headings.

### Firefox (Windows, Linux, Mac)

I use and recommend Firefox as a web browser, as it hits a sweet spot between privacy and functionality (I was using Brave but found that it'd get in the way of some things, like telemed appointments).

### Musicbee (Windows)

I'm old fashioned in buying my music in MP3 or FLAC format and using third party players to play it. Musicbee makes it easy to manage. I can also export to an m3u playlist which my Android phone understands and it will sync to it via the next mention, Syncthing.

### Syncthing (Windows, Linux, Mac, Android)

This is a small application which runs in the background and allows folders to synchronize between devices (after some initial setup). This is how I sync both my music and website files.
