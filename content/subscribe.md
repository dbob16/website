On this page you will find links to my RSS feeds for this site. Hugo generates them automagically so I figured that I might as well take advantage of them. Then I'll leave the rest up to my audience so they can choose what RSS reader they want to use.

To bring the links into the RSS reader, just simply right-click what feed you want to bring in, then Copy Link. From there add a source to your RSS reader then paste it for the source path/URL. Then you should get updates.

So here are the ones I'll link so far:
